# Shipping-calculator
This projects goal was to create a shipping calculator that will prompt and retrieve a item name, whether it is fragile or not, an order total, and to get a destination of the usa, aus, can, or the planet mars.
It will the formulate an output for a total and the fragile shipping amount for whatever destination is chosen through the four different If/else statements created.
You will then recieve the outputs of your inputed item name, the cost of shipping from one of the four statements, what country or planet you are shipping to, and what the end total of the shipment will be.
